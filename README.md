flipped-cam
===========

This project has the goal to make a framework when using the camera phone in iOS.

When using the UIImagePickerController, some of you must notice that the photo that the front camera takes is mirrored.

And even if you just invert the image taken from the delegate, the image displayed as preview one in the UIImagePickerController
is still mirrored, resulting in a bad experience by the user, who expects the camera works just as the camera APP.
